Simple surface engine for 2D games built on pygame

This is not an exhaustive game engine, it is a very simple engine to illustrate how a game engine can be built.
The samples have some examples on 2D simple games built with this engine.

It is built on [pygame](https://www.pygame.org), a ["set of Python modules designed for writing video games"](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).
Pygame itself is built on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) a cross-platform C graphics library.

Some other (more complete) game engines available for Python:

[Pygame zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io)\
[Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy)\
[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org)\

If looking for triple AAA game engine develpment tools, one can try:
[Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)

Unrteal engine languages are **Blueprints**, a visual scripting language, and **C++**.
