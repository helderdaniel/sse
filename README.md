# sse
Scene staging environment is a simple engine for 2D games built for Python.

This is not an exhaustive game engine, it is a very simple engine aimed at 2D game development.
The samples have some examples on 2D simple games built with this engine.

It is built on [pygame](https://www.pygame.org), a ["set of Python modules designed for writing video games"](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about).
Pygame itself is built on [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) a cross-platform C graphics library.

Some other (more complete) game engines available for Python:

[Pygame zero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io)\
[Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy)\
[Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org)\

SSE is not aimed for AAA game development. If looking for such an engine and tools, one can try: [Unreal engine](https://www.unrealengine.com)

Unreal engine languages are **Blueprints**, a visual scripting language, and **C++**.

However Unreal engine language is not Python, but Blueprints, a visual scripting language, and C++.
